# Python_Fundamentals
Python Fundamentals Session for ODSC West


### Abstract

For the Python Fundamentals session, we will start by ensuring we have Jupyter Notebook installed and then jump right into Python.  It will be a fast-paced crash course, covering the basics from data types and looping operations to more intermediate topics such as lambda expressions and object-oriented programming.  By the end of it, you will feel comfortable with Python syntax, and be able to use Python code to solve data analysis and mathematical problems that will form the foundation for more advanced sessions.  

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries and software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).  


The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python includes both of these prerequisites.
